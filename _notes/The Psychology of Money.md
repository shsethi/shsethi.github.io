**1. Buying expensive things**

When you buy a car which is very expensive when someone sees you driving that car they don't think that that person who's driving that car is so cool instead they think that if they had that car they would look cool so having something expensive doesn't make you always look better in fact it might take away attention from the person that is you and towards the position itself
