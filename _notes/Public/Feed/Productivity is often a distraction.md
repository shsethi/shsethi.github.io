- [[Productivity]] is often a distraction. 
Donâ€™t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.[^1]
- When [[public speaking]], pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.
