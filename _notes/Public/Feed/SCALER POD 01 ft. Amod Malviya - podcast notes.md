Overwhelmed by Frameworks 

- Frameworks can be many - underlying concepts are not that many
- Frameworks just make choices between these different choices and have different constraints
- Pick a popular framework , and go very deep
- Understand one framework deeply .
	- understand it conceptually rather syntactically 
	- Then you will be able to pattern match them across other frameworks
- At a company you might not be the one who decides a framework (or db, tech) but you should be the one who knows it so deeply that you can defend it.
