Trying to define what is bliss. 

Being in moment is bliss. You are not necessarily in comfort or joy.
You can be in pain but, when something is so engrossing it consumes you - and -  you get a feeling of  timeless-ness - that is bliss.


What i am trying to define here is very similar to concept of [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) as described by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#:~:text=Csikszentmihalyi%20was%20noted%20for%20his,and%20writing%20on%20the%20topic.)


If we can find immediate next challenge - that is  sufficiently difficult - that it requires our full attention. And we make it interesting so that we want to be in that moment and nowhere else . These two action can put us into a state that is  - i believe - higher than just happiness or joy.
