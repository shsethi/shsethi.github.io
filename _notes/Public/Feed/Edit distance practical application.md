When was the last time you had a direct implementation for an algorithm?

At work today we needed to filter out malformed email domains from a list of 4.2 Million email ids.
e.g gnail.com instead of gmail.com 

Looking at the problem, it just occurred to me 
Oh this can be done using -  [Levenshtein distance](https://pypi.org/project/editdistance/0.3.1/) (edit distance) 

I decided to use [pandas.py](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as it provided some high level constructs for manipulating csv.
Also found this simple package implementing editdistance:  [editdistance Â· PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/editdistance/0.3.1/)

In less than an hour, i hacked a script together using and we processed the 4.2M email ids to get 1342 email domains along with count of email ids using such domains.
