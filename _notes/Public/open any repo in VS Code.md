I have been using VS-code extensively since last month or so.
The feature that  has made me really excited is ability to work with repos remotely


You can open any repo in VS Code without cloning it.

**1. Directly in browser**
For example to browse through these examples https://github.com/revel/examples
you can replace com with dev https://github.dev/revel/examples


**2. Connecting local Vs code to github repo via extensions**
